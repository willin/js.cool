## Translations

## How to apply

- Fork this repo
- Add a new line for the domain you want to use
  Support: [CNAME](https://github.com/js-cool/js.cool/blob/master/main/active_cname.js) and [Custom NS](https://github.com/js-cool/js.cool/blob/master/main/active_ns.js)
- Make a Pull Request
- Wait for deployment

## Principe

- First of all, you need a site with content
- Check whether the subdomain is available
- Your site ~~must~~(will be nice to) have a Chinese translation edition
- Already finish web site development, or supply an opensource project you want a site for
- Illegal topics are forbbiden
- Irregular spot check to delete subdomains which have no content or not related to opensource
